# MLproj1
Machine Learning Project 1

## TODO (code):

### Part b
- perform a standard ordinary least square regression analysis using polynomials in x and y up to fifth order.
- Evaluate the mean Squared error
- Evaluate R^2
- Plot the resulting scores (MSE and R2) as functions of the polynomial degree (here up to polynomial degree five)
- Plot Î² as polynomial degree increases
- scaling/centering of the data (for example by subtracting the mean value)
- Split data in training and test data (using Scikit-Learn)
